# datetime_sync_bat
If for whatever reason you don't update your windows and your windows date & time is not enabled to "Set time automatically", this program will make it enabled. After enabling it, it will also check for successful synchronization to the time server.

# Usage
- Download `.bat` file.
- Put it somewhere maybe `C:\`
- Create shortcut of the file. This is important because we will make this run as administrator.
- Win + R then type `shell:startup`
- A directory will open. Copy the shortcut of the file you have made in step 3 to this directory.
- Right click the shortcut file and click Properties
- In the shortcut tab, click Advanced
- Check 'Run as Administrator'
